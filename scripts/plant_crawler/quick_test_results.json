Sepals 0.6–1.5 mm long; petals 3–11 mm long; ovary pubescent (rarely only at apex), 4-carpellate, completely syncarpous or with apical septicidal fissures; style pubescent toward base.Fruit usually rather sparsely pubescent and with a ring of dense, appressed hairs at base, but grading to tomentose or glabrous, completely syncarpous or with apical septicidal fissures, usually subglobose but grading to ellipsoid, pyriform, or broadly conical, sometimes lobed or ribbed, 5–15 mm wide, the epicarp drying 0.5–3 mm thick, with woody or subwoody mesocarp. Seeds 3–7 mm long.As seen in Taiwan, <i>Acronychia pedunculata</i> has leaves about 7–15 cm long with the leaflet blade about 6–12 cm long and 2.5–5 cm wide. The petals are about 5–6 mm long and the fruit, which is pubescent or sparsely so, is about 7–8 mm wide.",
